This is a security best practice to keep your credentials out of the code.\n",

        "    *   `SAFETY_SETTINGS`: For our academic exercises, these are turned off to prevent interference. In real-world applications, you would configure these carefully.\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **The `prompt_gemini` function**: This is the main tool you will use. Here are its most important parameters:\n",
        "    *   `input_prompt`: The list of contents (text, images, etc.) you want to send to the model.\n",
        "    *   `temperature`: Controls the randomness of the output. `0.0` makes the output deterministic and less creative, while a higher value (e.g., `0.7`) makes it more varied.\n",
        "    *   `schema`: A powerful feature that allows you to specify a JSON format for the model's output. This is extremely useful for structured data extraction.\n",
        "    *   `with_tokens_info`: If set to `True`, the function will also return the number of input and output tokens used, which is helpful for monitoring your usage against the free tier limits.\n",
        "\n",
        "In the following exercises, you will call this function with different prompts and configurations to solve various tasks.\n",

However, there are many well-researched and commonly accepted strategies that can significantly contribute to a happier life.\n\nHere's a breakdown of key areas to focus on:\n\n**1. Cultivate Positive Relationships:**\n\n*   **Nurture existing connections:** Invest time and effort in your relationships with family, friends, and partners. Deep, meaningful connections are a cornerstone of happiness.\n*   **Be present:** When you're with loved ones, put away distractions and truly listen and engage.\n*   **Practice gratitude for others:** Express your appreciation for the people in your life.\n*   **Seek out positive people:** Surround yourself with individuals who uplift and support you.\n\n**2. Practice Self-Care and Well-being:**\n\n*   **Prioritize physical health:**\n    *   **Exercise regularly:** Physical activity releases endorphins, which have mood-boosting effects.\n    *   **Eat a balanced diet:** Nourishing your body impacts your mental state.\n    *   **Get enough sleep:** Sleep deprivation can significantly affect mood and cognitive function.\n*   **Nurture your mental health:**\n    *   **Practice mindfulness and meditation:** These techniques can help you stay present, reduce stress, and increase self-awareness.\n    *   **Manage stress:** Identify your stressors and develop healthy coping mechanisms.\n    *   **Seek professional help when needed:** Don't hesitate to talk to a therapist or counselor if you're struggling with mental health challenges.\n*   **Engage in activities you enjoy:** Make time for hobbies, passions, and activities that bring you joy and a sense of flow.\n\n**3. Develop a Positive Mindset:**\n\n*   **Practice gratitude:** Regularly acknowledge and appreciate the good things in your life, no matter how small. This shifts your focus from what's lacking to what you have.\n*   **Challenge negative thoughts:** Become aware of your negative self-talk and actively try to reframe it into more balanced and positive perspectives.\n*   **Focus on the present:** While it's good to learn from the past and plan for the future, dwelling on either can lead to unhappiness. Practice being present in the moment.\n*   **Cultivate optimism:** Believe in your ability to overcome challenges and see the good in situations.\n\n**4. Find Meaning and Purpose:**\n\n*   **Identify your values:** What's truly important to you? Align your actions with your core values.\n*   **Set meaningful goals:** Work towards goals that are personally significant and contribute to something larger than yourself.\n*   **Contribute to something bigger:** Engage in activities that benefit others, whether through volunteering, helping a neighbor, or contributing to your community.\n*   **Find purpose in your work (if possible):** If your job doesn't align with your passions, find ways to make it more meaningful or seek opportunities that do.\n\n**5. Embrace Growth and Learning:**\n\n*   **Be open to new experiences:** Step outside your comfort zone and try new things. This can lead to personal growth and a broader perspective.\n*   **Continuously learn:** Read, take courses, or engage in activities that expand your knowledge and skills.\n*   **Embrace challenges as opportunities:** View difficulties as chances to learn and grow stronger.\n\n**6. Practice Self-Compassion:**\n\n*   **Be kind to yourself:** Treat yourself with the same understanding and compassion you would offer a friend.\n*   **Accept imperfections:** No one is perfect. Embrace your flaws and mistakes as part of the human experience.\n*   **Forgive yourself:** Let go of past regrets and mistakes.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   **Happiness is not a destination, but a journey:** It's not about achieving a permanent state of bliss, but about cultivating a life filled with moments of joy, contentment, and meaning.\n*   **It's okay to not be happy all the time:** Life has its ups and downs. Experiencing a range of emotions is normal and healthy.\n*   **Compare yourself to yourself, not others:** Social media can create unrealistic expectations. Focus on your own progress and journey.\n*   **Experiment and find what works for you:** Not all strategies will resonate with everyone. Be willing to try different approaches and see what brings you the most happiness.\n\n**To start, pick one or two areas that resonate with you and begin implementing small, consistent changes. The journey to happiness is a continuous process of self-discovery and intentional living.**"

It requires regular effort in a few key areas. Here is a guide to tending that garden.\n\n### Pillar 1: Cultivating Your Inner World (Mindset & Perspective)\n\nThis is your foundation. How you see the world and yourself determines a huge portion of your happiness.\n\n1.  **Practice Gratitude:** This is the single most powerful and scientifically-backed tool. It retrains your brain to focus on what you have, not what you lack.\n    *   **How to do it:** Every day, write down three specific things you are grateful for. \"I'm grateful for the warm sun on my face during my walk this morning.\" \"I'm grateful for the friend who sent me a funny text.\"\n\n2.  **Embrace Mindfulness & Presence:** Happiness is rarely found in worrying about the future or ruminating on the past. It's found *right now*.\n    *   **How to do it:** Take five minutes to focus on your breath. When you eat, just eat—notice the flavors and textures. When you walk, notice the feeling of your feet on the ground. This pulls you out of anxious thought loops and into the present moment.\n\n3.  **Develop Self-Compassion:** Many of us are our own harshest critics. Self-compassion is treating yourself with the same kindness you would offer a good friend who is struggling.\n    *   **How to do it:** When you make a mistake, instead of saying \"I'm so stupid,\" try saying, \"That was a difficult situation, and I did the best I could. It's okay to be imperfect.\"\n\n4.  **Adopt a Growth Mindset:** See challenges not as threats, but as opportunities to learn and grow. Believing you can improve and adapt makes you resilient and more open to new experiences.\n    *   **How to do it:** When you face a setback, ask \"What can I learn from this?\" instead of \"Why does this always happen to me?\"\n\n### Pillar 2: Building Healthy Habits & Actions\n\nYour daily actions are the seeds you plant in your garden.\n\n1.  **Prioritize Physical Health:** The mind-body connection is undeniable. You cannot feel mentally well if you are physically depleted.\n    *   **Move Your Body:** Aim for 30 minutes of moderate activity most days. It doesn't have to be intense; a brisk walk is fantastic for releasing endorphins and reducing stress.\n    *   **Nourish Yourself:** Eat a balanced diet with plenty of whole foods. What you eat directly affects your mood and energy levels.\n    *   **Get Enough Sleep:** Aim for 7-9 hours. Sleep is critical for emotional regulation and mental clarity. It's a non-negotiable.\n\n2.  **Engage in \"Flow\" States:** A flow state is when you are so completely absorbed in a challenging but achievable activity that you lose track of time. This is a deep source of satisfaction.\n    *   **How to find it:** This could be through a hobby (playing an instrument, painting, gardening), a sport, coding, or even becoming deeply engrossed in a project at work.\n\n3.  **Spend Time in Nature:** Being outdoors has a proven restorative effect on our minds. It reduces stress, improves focus, and boosts our mood.\n    *   **How to do it:** Go for a walk in a park, sit by a lake, or simply tend to a houseplant.\n\n### Pillar 3: Nurturing Connection & Relationships\n\nHumans are social creatures. Deep, meaningful connections are a fundamental predictor of long-term happiness.\n\n1.  **Invest in Quality Relationships:** Focus on the depth, not the number, of your connections. Spend time with people who uplift you, support you, and allow you to be your authentic self.\n    *   **How to do it:** Schedule regular time with loved ones. Put your phone away when you're with them. Practice active listening.\n\n2.  **Practice Kindness & Generosity:** Giving to others—whether it's your time, a compliment, or a small gift—activates the pleasure centers in your brain. It connects you to something larger than yourself.\n    *   **How to do it:** Volunteer for a cause you care about. Do a small, unexpected favor for a neighbor. Give a genuine compliment to a coworker.\n\n### Pillar 4: Finding Purpose & Meaning\n\nHappiness isn't just about feeling good; it's about living a life that feels meaningful.\n\n1.  **Know Your Values:** What is most important to you in life? (e.g., creativity, honesty, security, adventure, community). When your actions align with your values, you feel a sense of integrity and peace.\n    *   **How to do it:** Take some time to write down your top 5 core values. When making a big decision, ask yourself which option best aligns with those values.\n\n2.  **Contribute to Something Bigger Than Yourself:** This is about moving beyond your own needs and wants. It could be through your work, your family, your community, or a creative project.\n    *   **How to do it:** This doesn't mean you have to save the world. It can be as simple as being a reliable parent, a supportive mentor, or creating something that brings joy to others.\n\n### What to Let Go Of (The Happiness Traps)\n\nSometimes, happiness is less about adding things and more about removing what's holding you back.\n\n*   **Comparison:** Stop comparing your life to the curated \"highlight reels\" you see on social media. Your journey is your own.\n*   **Perfectionism:** Striving for excellence is good; demanding perfection is a recipe for anxiety and disappointment. Embrace \"good enough.\"\n*   **External Validation:** Don't tie your self-worth to likes, promotions, or the approval of others. Cultivate an inner sense of validation.\n\n**Final Thought:**\n\nBe patient. Happiness is a practice, like learning an instrument. Some days you'll play beautifully, and other days you'll be out of tune. The key is to just keep practicing. Start small. Pick one thing from this list and try it for a week.\n\nAnd most importantly, if you are struggling with persistent unhappiness, anxiety, or depression, please consider seeking help from a therapist or counselor. They can provide you with professional tools and support tailored to your specific needs."

              " 'text': '**Page 1**\\n\"\"\"\\nDan Baldwin\\nGroup 4\\nAuteur Review - Interstellar \\nI believe Christopher Nolan: the director behind the 2014 sci-ﬁ/adventure cinematic ‘Interstellar,’ \\nto be a very intellectual and imaginative inventive talent.  \\nHis style in his previous ﬁlms sets characters in epic unique locations, with gargantuan issues to \\nface, and artistically impresses the audience with how the characters solve their problems. For \\nexample, in Nolan’s 2010 ﬁlm ‘Inception,’ he tackles the idea of dreams, and sets his characters \\ndiving through dreams within dreams within even more dreams to complete their goals. Because \\nthis idea is so farfetched, and dreams are a subject in which science has made little factual \\ndiscovery in, Nolan is free to use his creativity to present ideas such as landscapes folding in on \\nthemselves and corridors spinning, without seeming unrealistic. \\nThis brain-racking epic theme is once again evident in ‘Interstellar,’ as Nolan sets his characters \\nduring a second American dust bowl on future Earth. The world is short of food, and will soon be \\nuninhabitable. So, ex-NASA pilot ‘Cooper’ (Matthew McConaughey) is summoned back to space \\ntravel in a bid to ﬁnd a new planet for the species to inhabit. Luckily for Cooper and his team, a \\nblack hole orbiting Saturn can transport them further into space to land on these potential \\nplanets. \\nThroughout the ﬂick, the crew explore multiple worlds - again feeding Nolan’s mind more \\nopportunities to create crazy scenarios. For example, one planet that Cooper and his friends, \\n‘Brand,’ (Anne Hathaway) and ‘Romilly,’ (David Gyasi) visit initially seems like an inﬁnite sea of two \\nfeet deep water. Not threatening at all right? Well think again, because the crew suddenly ﬁnd out \\nthat a giant 100ft tidal wave is about to hit them, and they have minutes to ﬂy away. Nolan further \\nincreases the stakes in this scene as it is explained that every hour spent on this planet counts for \\nseven years on earth, meaning the planet will be destroyed before they return if their ship sinks. \\nAt the climax of the ﬁlm, the crew end up sending themselves through a black hole into a \\ntesseract (a 3D representation of a larger dimension) to ﬁnd the ‘secret to harnessing gravity’ \\nwhich will let the human race bend space-time in order to survive oﬀ earth. I know. Mental. \\nThe imagination that Nolan possesses and implicates into ‘Interstellar’ is farfetched and \\nwonderful, not only impressing his audience with the appealing visuals he creates, but induces \\nthem to think and discuss what is going on due its scientiﬁc depth. Personally, as someone who is \\nbamboozled by the idea of how big the universe is, I ﬁnd it unendingly entertaining to repeatedly \\nwatch this ﬁlm and understanding it more each time, and can only hope the technology portrayed \\nwill one day come true. \\nOverall, ‘Interstellar’ is a clear example of Nolan’s auteur talent, as he once again ﬁgments yet \\nanother cluster of conditions for us to marvel at. With a fantastic score from world famous \\ncomposer Hanz Zimmer, his epic, orchestral theme sets the audience in the palm of his hands as \\nwe stress over how we are all going to be saved once again.\\n\"\"\"\\n\\n',\n",

        "RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) is a technique where a language model combines document retrieval with text generation. In RAG, a retrieval system first finds relevant documents or text chunks, and then the language model uses this retrieved information to generate a more informed and accurate response. This method enhances the model's ability to answer questions by grounding its responses in real, external data.\n",
        "\n",
        "In the following code, we will load a webpage as a document, which allows us to retrieve text from a URL. After loading the content, we will split the document into smaller, manageable chunks, making it easier for our model to process. Then, we'll generate embeddings for these chunks with a specified LLM model (Gemini Embedding Model). These embeddings will be stored in a vector database, which enables us to perform similarity searches. By setting up this retrieval system, we can use a RAG chain to answer questions. The retriever finds relevant text chunks from the document based on a query, and the LLM generates a response by incorporating this retrieved information, making the answers more grounded and accurate.\n",

This requires training AI models on diverse datasets and continuously monitoring their performance for any biases.\n*   **Privacy:** Protecting user data is a top priority. This necessitates the implementation of strong privacy measures and transparent policies from companies regarding data usage.\n*   **Accountability:** Establishing clear guidelines for responsibility for decisions made by AGI systems is essential. This involves creating legal frameworks that define accountability in cases of mistakes or harm caused by AI actions.\n\nAddressing these factors through collaboration between researchers, policymakers, and industry leaders is vital to ensure AGI benefits society while minimizing potential risks."

        "Few-shot prompting is a technique where a Large Language Model (LLM) is given a small number of labeled examples within a prompt to guide its classification. This allows the model to perform a new task with minimal data, avoiding the need for extensive fine-tuning.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this lab, we will use the Gemini API to perform zero-shot, 1-shot, and 5-shot emotion classification:\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Zero-shot:** The model classifies text without any prior examples.\n",
        "*   **1-shot:** The model is given one example for each emotion before classifying.\n",
        "*   **5-shot:** The model is given five examples per emotion for better context.\n",
        "\n",
        "To make our implementation robust and efficient, we are incorporating two key features:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Structured Output:** We provide the Gemini model with a specific output schema (`Emotions` class). This instructs the model to return *only* a valid emotion label (e.g., `joy`), which makes the output predictable and reliable, minimizing errors.\n",
        "2.  **API Rate Handling:** The code includes a function to manage the requests-per-minute limit of the Gemini API.\n",
        "\n",
        "We will test the model's performance on a small sample of 20 texts per emotion to ensure the process runs quickly. If the model provides an invalid response, the code will automatically retry the request until a valid classification is received.\n",
        "\n",

        "- **Advanced topic - QLoRA (Quantized Low-Rank Adapter):** QLoRA is a method used to make fine-tuning large language models more efficient. It works by adding a small, trainable part (LoRA) to a pre-trained model, while keeping the rest of the model frozen. At the same time, it reduces the size of the model’s data using a process called quantization, which makes the model require less memory. This allows you to fine-tune large models without needing as much computational power, making it easier to adapt models for specific tasks.
